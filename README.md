This is the patterns for jazz project, a collection of printable and playable patterns for learning the basics of jazz, composition in general, and ear training. This project is made possible by two awesome projects:

* Lilypond, http://lilypond.org
* Abjad, http://abjad.mbrsi.org/

You must install Lilypond using the installers provided on the abovementioned Lilypond web site. I recommend that you install all of your Python-related stuff in a virtualenv, especially when working on Mac or a Linux distribution (especially those so-called LTS distributions, which feature an ancient Python experience in general).

# Installation

For now, I only provide installation instructions for OS X. The Linux setup is similar and is one I have tested but don't have time to document right now. Will hopefully get around to it soon. 

1. If you aren't running MacPorts (http://macports.org) or HomeBrew (http://brew.sh), do it now.
