Downloading
===============

For now, we provide limited details.

The source code is hosted on Bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/ctsdh/jpatterns.

The printable scores can be downloaded from Figshare at http://figshare.com/articles/jpatterns/888467. Please note that this collection is updated a bit irregularly. If you see any patterns missing, based on your study of the Bitbucket code, simply download the code and run the `build.sh` script. This will give you all of the pattenrs as PDF and MIDI.

You can listen to some patterns at https://soundcloud.com/gkt-music. Similiar to the printed scores, you should build from source if you want to listen to all of the patterns.
