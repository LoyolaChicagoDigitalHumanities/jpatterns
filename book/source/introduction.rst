Introduction
==================

This project was started by George K. Thiruvathukal, Professor of CS at Loyola
University Chicago, who has a lifelong interest in music. Like many, he
started as a classical musician and wanted to spend more time on his interests
in composing and improvising. After studying a number of books on jazz piano,
he became interested in using algorithmic music toolkits to generate notated
versions (and lead sheets) of many patterns/etudes that jazz musicians (and
pianists) need to practice to master the jazz idiom.

Many of the patterns you'll see in this project are inspired by various 
books, especially the legendary Patterns for Jazz. We also cover a number of
ubiquitous patterns for learning various progressions (e.g. the famous II-V-I
progression, blues scales, and the like). While it is easy to learn these scales
in some keys, in other less-familiar keys (we all are fluent in the G#-minor scale, 
right?) it can sometimes be helpful to have a notated version in front of you, at
least for practicing and training your ear properly. More importantly, using the
Abjad toolkit, we can get MIDI output, which means you can train your ear by 
listening to the MIDI files--even if you have no interest in playing any of the
patterns on your instrument.

The focus of these patterns is on treble clef instruments. Many of the patterns
are focused on piano playing. This reflects the bias of the author, of course. 
We welcome participation from others who may want to tailor this work for their
own favorite instruments.
